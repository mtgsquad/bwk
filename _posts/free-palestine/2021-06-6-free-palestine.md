I've stayed silent for a long period of time now. And to be honest I'm out words for the torture Palestine facing! It's the right time for me to speak up. I mean how is this fair at all that we are living a peaceful life while kids,adults and elderly people are losing their loved ones everyday. It breaks my heart to see young children who have nothing to eat,drink and wear. We all have to make a pledge that we all stand together with Palestine and together we all will make a difference.. Let's show our Muslim brother and sisters that they have people who support them and people who care for them.

Stay Safe, COVID-19 is spreading. May all of you have a great year.
